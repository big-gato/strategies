# how not to lose troops

tl;dr no troops in the training ground
* keep a shield and garrison allies until hospital is full
* send troops in mines or garrison shielded allies
* in case of emergency, rally attack your opponent to get a fast protective buffer

### Principle

When getting attacked, you can only lose troops stationed in your base. There are a number of ways to "have" troops but not lose them while your opponents are targeting you

## hospital

Troops in the hospital "Severely Wounded Units" cannot be killed.  
Did you know you can also "store" troops in the "healing in progress" queue ?  
Even when the healing is done, as long as you don't "release" the troops, they are in a safe haven.

#### how to use it ?

* The hospital is filling when you fight
* The ratio killed / wounded is best when defending => garrison your allies
* Don't heal your troops bit by bit, let the hospital get *almost* full 
* Heal big batches of troops in one go, they go in the "second" buffer...
* ...Hospital fills again.


**You don't accelerate or pop this buffer until you actively need more troop, or the hospital is about to be full again**

## troops out

Squads carry troops with them.

* when moving
* mining
* garrisoned
* **RALLYING !**

### caveat
You can store much less than with the hospital, and squads "keeping troop" are useless for other purposes... but it's easier and faster to get troops in and out.

#### mines
Putting troops in mine is usually very easy and fast, if you don't have a better option it's always there.  
But they can still be attacked so put them a little bit further from your base or they will be found

#### garrisoned
Garrison an ally with a shield to get an indestructible safe space.
Be careful that if your ally tp, your troops come back to base.

#### moving
Moving a squad around makes it impossible to target, so you can combine mine and movement by targetting a very faraway mine.

#### rallying
Rallying is a very effective and quick way to get a squad "out" while it is technically still in your base.  
You can let an attack pass, the attacker will see you lose no troops and give up, then you can cancel the rally.
