# principle of breach troop loss

When a base is attacked and the defender loses the fight, the base is "breached" and a penalty of troop killed is inflicted to the defender.

| ![screen capture of a heavily defended wall](../imgs/image.png) | Breaching a base means having a squad strong enough to win the fight. This one is hard |
| ![screen capture of an undefend wall](../imgs/image.png) | But sometimes there are no defenses |
| ![screen capture of undefended breach penalty](../imgs/image.png) | Undefended bases won't lose troops during fight, but if they are attacked they always lose, and the breach penalty is applied fully |

## here comes the crow
A single lvl 1 blue hero from a level 1 HQ is going to do the same damage when breaching base as the most potent squad of the fattest whale. This is the **crow**.

| the base is breached and there are breach penalty losses : hit the base until it is ashed. It usually does around 4 thousand troop kills in one ashing... | ![screen capture of undefended breach penalty](../imgs/image.png) |

## observing the battlefield and reports information

The crowmaster wants to fight on their term. They are actively scouting to find undefended bases and avoid losing their crow to a defended wall.

Then when a scout arrives, the crow master immediately checks the report

* if the base is undefended, the crow attacks
* if the base is defended by extremely powerful squads, the report can be ignored
* if the base is defended by low level squads, even if garrisoned, the report should be shared to allies for eradication

The crow should be vigilant to every troop movement : garrisons, troops going out on attacks or coming back... The report information becomes obsolete fast, and seeing troops go out is a good information of an open vulnerability

## Mobility

|-|-|
| When the report is conclusive and the crow should attack the base, if it is too far from the target, it will take a long time to attack. | ![screen capture of a long direct attack time](../imgs/image.png) |
| The best way to reach destination is to target a mine behind the objective : the move speed is much faster ! | ![screen capture of trajectory intersecting the target base](../imgs/image.png) |
| And also the targeted player is not informed of the incoming attack until the last second. | ![screen capture gif of a last second attack](../imgs/image.png) |

When a crowmaster starts to be more at ease with the tactic, they can try to time the arrival of the scout to the crow behind in the neighbourood of the targets.

## Vulnerability
Either because the crowmaster has already lost all troops, or because they uses some of the troop conservation tactics, there should never be troops on the training ground while the crowmaster is hunting for preys.  
At first, it is a good idea to practice further from the mud, where the range is dissuading players from counter attacking.  
When the tactic gets mastered, going in the mud is not a problem and the more crows there are, the less likely any player is to be a target.
